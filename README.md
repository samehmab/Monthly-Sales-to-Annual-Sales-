This Excel project empowers you to analyze and visualize your sales performance by comparing monthly sales figures to annual sales and historical trends from previous years.

## Benefits:

Gain Insights: Understand the relative contribution of each month's sales to your annual target.
Identify Trends: Track growth or decline patterns over time by comparing monthly sales data year-over-year.
Data Visualization: Present your findings in a clear and visually appealing way to facilitate communication and decision-making.
How to Use:

## Prepare Your Data:
Enter your monthly sales data in the "Data" worksheet.
Ensure your data includes a date/time column for each sale entry.
Include data for at least two years to enable YoY comparison.
In cell B1 of the "Data" sheet, specify the name of your sales metric (e.g., "Sales Amount").
## Analyze Performance:
The "Analysis" sheet automatically calculates and displays the following:
Monthly Sales Breakdown: This section shows the percentage contribution of each month's sales to the annual total.
YoY Sales Comparison: This section compares the current month's sales to the same month in the previous year, highlighting growth or decline trends.
Formulas used in the calculations are displayed for transparency, allowing you to adjust cell references if needed.
Output:

## The "Analysis" sheet provides:
Monthly Sales Percentage: For each month, the percentage it contributes to annual sales.
YoY Sales Growth/Decline: The percentage change in sales compared to the same month in the previous year.
You can customize formatting (e.g., color coding) to improve readability and highlight key trends.
